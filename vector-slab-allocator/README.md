# Vector Slab Allocator

## Running the code
I've been testing using the Homebrew version of clang (version 7.0.1).

You can run `./compile.sh Debug` or `./compile.sh Release` to run cmake in
Debug or Release, and build all the executables. It's a simple file so I don't
have to remember the CMake commands.

Additionally, providing additional arguments to `./compile.sh` will produce a
`.clang_complete` file used by my Spacemacs config.
