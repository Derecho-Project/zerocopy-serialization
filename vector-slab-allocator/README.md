# Vector Slab Allocator

## Running the code
I've been testing using the Homebrew version of clang (version 7.0.1).

You can run `./compile.sh` to run cmake and build all the executables. It's a
simple file so I don't have to remember the CMake commands.
Additionally, providing any argument to `./compile.sh` will produce a
`.clang_complete` file used by my Spacemacs config.
